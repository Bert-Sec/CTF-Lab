In the **Web Exploitation** category, youâ€™ll tackle challenges that involve finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. This may include:

- **SQL Injection**: Manipulating queries to interact with a database.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting scripts to affect how the site behaves.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Gaining control over server-side code.

Each challenge is crafted to teach you about common web security issues and how attackers find, exploit, and report them. Solutions for these challenges are designed to help you understand web exploitation techniques in real-world scenarios.
