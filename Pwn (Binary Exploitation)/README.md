### Pwn (Binary Exploitation)

The **Pwn** section is all about binary exploitation, where you learn how to control the execution flow of a program to achieve unintended behavior. Topics covered include:

- **Buffer Overflows**: Exploiting memory handling vulnerabilities.
- **Format String Attacks**: Manipulating input to control memory access.
- **Return Oriented Programming (ROP)**: Using small code snippets to bypass defenses.

These challenges are intended to provide you with hands-on experience in exploiting binary applications, a core skill in offensive cybersecurity.
