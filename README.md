### Web Exploitation

In the **Web Exploitation** category, you’ll tackle challenges that involve finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. This may include:

- **SQL Injection**: Manipulating queries to interact with a database.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting scripts to affect how the site behaves.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Gaining control over server-side code.

Each challenge is crafted to teach you about common web security issues and how attackers find, exploit, and report them. Solutions for these challenges are designed to help you understand web exploitation techniques in real-world scenarios.

### Cryptography

The **Cryptography** section includes challenges focused on encoding, encryption, and decryption techniques. Here, you’ll explore concepts like:

- **Classic Ciphers** (e.g., Caesar, Vigenère)
- **Modern Cryptography** (e.g., RSA, AES)
- **Hashing and Encoding Schemes** (e.g., Base64, MD5)

Cryptography challenges are excellent for learning how information is protected and the methods used to break or understand encrypted messages. These challenges will enhance your ability to analyze encrypted data and develop strong cryptographic intuition.

### Reverse Engineering

In the **Reverse Engineering** category, you’ll be working with compiled code to uncover its original purpose or exploit it. Key topics include:

- **Disassembly and Decompiling**: Converting compiled code into readable form.
- **Binary Analysis**: Studying executable files to understand how they work.
- **Patching and Debugging**: Modifying binaries or troubleshooting code execution.

These challenges are designed to help you develop skills in examining and understanding software at the binary level, which is useful for malware analysis and vulnerability discovery.

### OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)

**OSINT** challenges focus on gathering intelligence from publicly available sources. You'll practice finding information online and correlating it with challenge requirements. Skills covered include:

- **Data Gathering and Analysis**: Using search engines and tools to collect data.
- **Social Media Investigation**: Finding connections or sensitive information from public profiles.
- **Geolocation and Metadata Extraction**: Using images and data to identify locations or device information.

OSINT is a valuable skill in cybersecurity, offering ways to gather actionable intelligence using legally accessible data.

### Pwn (Binary Exploitation)

The **Pwn** section is all about binary exploitation, where you learn how to control the execution flow of a program to achieve unintended behavior. Topics covered include:

- **Buffer Overflows**: Exploiting memory handling vulnerabilities.
- **Format String Attacks**: Manipulating input to control memory access.
- **Return Oriented Programming (ROP)**: Using small code snippets to bypass defenses.

These challenges are intended to provide you with hands-on experience in exploiting binary applications, a core skill in offensive cybersecurity.

### Miscellaneous

The **Miscellaneous** category includes challenges that don’t fit neatly into other categories but are essential for a well-rounded skill set. Topics may include:

- **Steganography**: Hiding and finding data within images, audio, or other media.
- **Obfuscation and Encoding**: Decoding and understanding hidden messages.
- **Puzzle-Solving and Logic Challenges**: Tests of creative thinking and problem-solving.

This section is ideal for expanding your general problem-solving skills and exposing you to unique CTF problems that require out-of-the-box thinking.

---

### Forensics

**Forensics** challenges involve investigating digital artifacts to uncover evidence or secrets. Skills developed here include:

- **Memory and Disk Analysis**: Exploring system memory dumps or disk images.
- **Log Analysis**: Reviewing event logs to trace activities.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Examining packet captures to understand communication patterns.

Forensics challenges give you experience with digital investigation techniques commonly used in incident response and forensic analysis.
