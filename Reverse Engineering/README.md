### Reverse Engineering

In the **Reverse Engineering** category, youâ€™ll be working with compiled code to uncover its original purpose or exploit it. Key topics include:

- **Disassembly and Decompiling**: Converting compiled code into readable form.
- **Binary Analysis**: Studying executable files to understand how they work.
- **Patching and Debugging**: Modifying binaries or troubleshooting code execution.

These challenges are designed to help you develop skills in examining and understanding software at the binary level, which is useful for malware analysis and vulnerability discovery.
