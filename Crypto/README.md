### Crypto

The **Cryptography** section includes challenges focused on encoding, encryption, and decryption techniques. Here, you’ll explore concepts like:

- **Classic Ciphers** (e.g., Caesar, Vigenère)
- **Modern Cryptography** (e.g., RSA, AES)
- **Hashing and Encoding Schemes** (e.g., Base64, MD5)

Cryptography challenges are excellent for learning how information is protected and the methods used to break or understand encrypted messages. These challenges will enhance your ability to analyze encrypted data and develop strong cryptographic intuition.
